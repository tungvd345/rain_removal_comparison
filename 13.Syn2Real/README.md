We propose a Gaussian Process-based semi-supervised learning framework which enables the network in learning to derain using synthetic dataset while generalizing better using  unlabeled real-world images. Through extensive experiments and ablations on several challenging datasets (such as Rain800, Rain200H and DDN-SIRR), we show that the proposed method, when trained on limited labeled data, achieves on-par performance with fully-labeled training. Additionally, we demonstrate that using unlabeled real-world images in the proposed GP-based framework results in superior performance as compared to existing methods.

## Prerequisites:
1. Linux
2. Python 2 or 3
3. Pytorch version >=1.0
4. CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN (CUDA 8.0)

## Dataset structure
1. download the rain datasets and arrange the rainy images and clean images in the following order
2. Save the image names into text file (dataset_filename.txt)
```
   .
    ├── data 
    |   ├── train # Training  
    |   |   ├── derain        
    |   |   |   ├── <dataset_name>   
    |   |   |   |   ├── rain              # rain images 
    |   |   |   |   └── norain            # clean images
    |   |   |   └── dataset_filename.txt
    |   └── test  # Testing
    |   |   ├── derain         
    |   |   |   ├── <dataset_name>          
    |   |   |   |   ├── rain              # rain images 
    |   |   |   |   └── norain            # clean images
    |   |   |   └── dataset_filename.txt
```

## To test Syn2Real:
1. mention test dataset text file in the line 57 of test.py, for example
```    
    val_filename = 'SIRR_test.txt'
```
2. Run the following command
```   
    python test.py -category derain -exp_name DDN_SIRR_withGP
```
## To train Syn2Real:
1. mention the labeled, unlabeled, and validation dataset in lines 119-121 of train.py, for example
```
    labeled_name = 'DDN_100_split1.txt'
    unlabeled_name = 'real_input_split1.txt'
    val_filename = 'SIRR_test.txt'
``` 
2. Run the following command
```
    python train.py  -train_batch_size 2  -category derain -exp_name DDN_SIRR_withGP  -lambda_GP 0.015 -epoch_start 0
```
